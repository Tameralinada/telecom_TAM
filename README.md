## Overview

The **Telecom TAM Analysis** notebook provides a structured approach to exploring telecom customer data, with sections dedicated to data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling. This notebook is particularly useful for telecom analysts and data scientists looking to understand customer churn, lifetime value, and other key metrics.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw telecom data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes customer trends, usage patterns, and distribution across different segments.
- **Feature Engineering**: Generates new variables and transforms existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict customer churn or other outcomes.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Summarizes key insights and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
